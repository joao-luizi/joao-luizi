## Hi there, Iâ€™m Joao ðŸ‘‹
### Aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for programming.
<ins>I'm currently studying at 42 School Lisbon.

I spent 12 years in healthcare as a healthcare technician, where I began automating day-to-day tasks with VBA and later moved on to C# with WinForms using a bit of SQL for in-house data warehousing. 

Eventually, I managed a social service project with around 200 people, but my passion for programming never went away and during the pandemic, I decided to fully transition into tech. 

As a father of two young kids, I donâ€™t have much time off, but gaming remains one of my best outletsâ€”
>Origin: We create worlds

still feels like the best tagline a computer software house ever had. 

I'm also interested in deepening my understanding of AI and cybersecurity, though Iâ€™m focused on finishing the 42 common core first, as spreading myself too thin can become a real issue.

### What Iâ€™m working on:

School 42 Common Core

C# Academy

freeCodeCamp

### Tech Iâ€™m using:

C, C#, SQL
